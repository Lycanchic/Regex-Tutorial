## What is Regex?
***

A regular expression, commonly referred to as "`regex`"  or "regexp," is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is mainly used to search, match, and manipulate text or strings.

## Summary

`Regex` is a powerful tool for text processing. It is widely used in many programming languages such as Java, Python, and more. In `regex`, a pattern is described using a special syntax that includes a set of symbols and special characters. These patterns can then be used to search for and match patterns in strings.
