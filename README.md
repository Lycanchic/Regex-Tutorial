## What is Regex?
***

A regular expression, commonly referred to as "`regex`"  or "regexp," is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is mainly used to search, match, and manipulate text or strings.

## Summary
***

`Regex` is a powerful tool for text processing. It is widely used in many programming languages such as Java, Python, and more. In `regex`, a pattern is described using a special syntax that includes a set of symbols and special characters. These patterns can then be used to search for and match patterns in strings.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
***
In regular expressions, "anchors" are special characters that match a position in the input string, rather than a character. There are two common anchors used in matching email addresses: The "^" anchor matches the start of a line, while the "$" anchor matches the end of a line. These anchors are often used together in a regex pattern to  ensure that the entire input string is matched, rather than just a substring.

For example, if you wanted to match a valid email address using regex, you could use the following:

```
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
```
This pattern uses the "^" snd the "$" anchors to ensure that the entire input string matches the pattern of an email address.
